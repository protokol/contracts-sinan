# Introduction 
Sinan Energy is a blockchain enabled decentralized energy utility that builds tokenized renewable energy power plants – enabling individual and institutional investors and major corporates to accumulate carbon credits directly from the operation of utility scale power infrastructure

Unlike other crypto energy offerings, we don’t just trade energy, we design and build the power plants that generate renewable energy and related carbon credits

## Sinan Energy Token (SET)
The Sinan Energy Token (SET) is a crypto asset  that allows the holder direct rights to the carbon credits accrued as a result of production of renewable energy from real operating power plants. SE Tokens therefore represent real intrinsic value based on carbon credits derived from the generation and sale of green energy. Initial launch of SET will take place from the 13th January 2022 on CopperLaunch. 

Sinan selects high value renewable energy plants for development that generates certified carbon credits through the sale of green energy to commercial and industrial sector clients across the developing world

Sinan only issues SET Tokens for projects with a signed Power Purchase Agreement and that is permitted and ready for construction

Token holders automatically receive carbon credits gained from the operation of the underlying renewable energy assets. Carbon credits are expected to increase ten-fold in value over the next decade. This presents significant upside yield to token holders.

## Sinan Carbon Credit Token

The Sinan Carbon Credit Token (SCC) is a token representing a certified carbon credit derived from emissions savings using renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuel power generation. Sinan Energy Token holders receive SCC tokens as rewards. Given the high levels of dirty coal prevalent in most developing economies, Sinan Renewable Energy Plants displace amongst the highest levels of carbon and other noxious emissions than almost any other similar renewable energy project.


Over the past 5 years Carbon Credits have achieved growth of 690% and a Sharpe Ratio of 3.35, during the same time Bitcoin had a Sharpe Ratio of 1.66 while the S&P 500 had a ratio of 0.99 and gold a ratio of 1.02. This clearly demonstrates the opportunity this new asset class represents in providing a risk reward ratio that far exceeds other major investments and is uncorrelated to other asset classes
